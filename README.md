# Stock Trader - Web Version

Experimental Blazor app that can connect to various trading gateway, receive quotes, and send orders. 
In this version, only simulated gateway with preloaded quotes is available. 

# Disclaimer

**This version is not maintained anymore**. There is a couple of synchronization issues with async queries clean-up after continuous connecting and disconnecting from gateway. This and some other missing features in Blazor, like missing interaction with cookies, makes Blazor look not ready for using in production.
